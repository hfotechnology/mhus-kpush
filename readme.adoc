== Purpose

The tool will push local files into kubernetes containers to support
local development in a kubernetes environment.

The tool will use 'kubectl cp' and 'kubectl exec' to push and validate files
in the container. No installation of components in the cluster are needed. Only
a basic commandset 'bash', 'ls', 'mkdir', 'rm' is recommended in the container.

== Program Arguments

== Configuration

For each job push a yaml file in the configuration folder.

=== Main Section

|===
|Parameter  |Type   |Description
|name       |Text   |Name of the configuration, for log file (default is the file name without extension)
|description|Text   |Description of the configuration
|namespace  |Text   |Kubernetes namespace
|pod        |*Text  |Kubernetes name of the pod
|container  |Text   |Kubernetes container inside of the pod
|enabled    |Boolean|Disable the job (default true)
|===

=== Watch Section

|===
|Parameter  |Type   |Description

|source     |*Text  |Local path to the source directory
|target     |*Text  |Remote path to the target directory
|filter     |List   |List of filters to filter the local files and directories
|algorithm  |Text   |Implementation to use to watch and transport files, default 'simple'
|interval   |Number |Interval in milliseconds to wait between file scans in watch mode, default global interval
|enabled    |Boolean|Disable the watch section (default true)
|===

=== Filters

|===
|Parameter      |Description
|contains       |Accept if path contains the value
|notcontains    |Deny if the path contains the value
|regex          |Accept if the path matches the value as regex
|notregex       |Deny if the path matches the value as regex
|namecontains   |Accept if the name contains the value
|notnamecontains|Deny if the name contains the value
|dircontains    |Accept directory if the name contains the value
|notdircontains |Deny directory if the name contains the value
|===

=== Simple algorithm

NOTE: algorithm: simple

A algorithm using `kubectl` to transport files. It's using `kubectl cp` and `kubectl exec` with `ls`, `mkdir`. The sync will
store the last sync time beside the configuration file as `*.kpush` file. If no file is found the current time is used.


If init is enabled, initial it will transport only non existing files.

|===
|Parameter      |Type   |Description
|ignoreInit     |bool   |Ignore initial process, default true
|rememberLastUpdated|bool|default false
|===

The additional parameter in `Main Section` named `kubectl` can be used to change the path to the kubectl binary.

=== Example

----

name: mhus to karaf
description: push all changes in local repository mhus into the karaf container

namespace: mhus
pod: server
container: karaf
  
properties:
- versions.properties

watch:
- name: Repo mhus
  source: ~/.m2/repository/de/mhus
  target: /home/user/.m2/repository/de/mhus
  filter: 
  - contains ""
  
----

== Examples

Create the file project1.yaml in `~/.kush/config`:

----

pod: project-0
container: karaf

watch:
- name: MVN Repo
  source: ~/.m2/repository/de/mhus
  target: /home/user/.m2/repository/de/mhus
  filter: 
  - contains "7."
  
----

This will push all files with version 7.* to the pod project-0.

. `kpush push project1` will not push files because it's the first start and the update timestamp will be now.
. compile some maven projects in `/home/user/.m2/repository/de/mhus`
. `kpush push project1` will now push the compiled files
. `kpush push project1` will not push any new files
. `kpush -t 6h touch project1` set the update timestamp to 6 hours in the past
. `kpush push project1` will now push the compiled files of the last 6 hours

`kpush watch` will continuous push files.
