== Purpose

The tool will push local files into kubernetes containers to support
local development in a kubernetes environment.

The tool will use 'kubectl cp' and 'kubectl exec' to push and validate files
in the container. No installation of components in the cluster are needed. Only
a basic commandset 'bash', 'ls', 'mkdir', 'rm' is recommended in the container.

== Configuration

For each job push a yaml file in the configuration folder.
